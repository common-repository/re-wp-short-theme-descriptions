Shortens the theme descriptions in the theme overview of your wordpress installation.
Mouse over to expand all descriptions again. For WP 3.3 and less. not for 3.4+

== Description ==

Some theme authors makes really long theme desctiptions and add a ton of tags.
When you have many themes uploaded to your WordPress installation, this can make the overview look messed up.
Install this plugin to make the theme descriptions short.
You can simpy disable the plugin if you at some point want to read all the info again.

Since WP 3.4 the developers have reorganized the theme overview screen, rendering this plugin depricated.
Only install if you still run 3.3 or below, and dislike long theme descriptions :)


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload it to the plugins folder of your blog.
3. Goto the Plugins section of the WordPress admin and activate the plugin.
